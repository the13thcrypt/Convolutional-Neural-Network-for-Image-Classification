# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in PyTorch for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This notebook covers the full workflow: loading and transforming data, defining a custom CNN model, training, saving/loading weights, and evaluating test accuracy. It also includes a helper for predicting custom images.
